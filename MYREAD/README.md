Based on the problem statement in the screenshot, here’s a solution approach in Python.

### Problem Summary:
- A single-line keyboard has digits `0-9` in a specific order provided in `digits`.
- Given `num`, a sequence of digits, calculate the total time in milliseconds to type `num`.
- Moving from one digit position to another takes `|a - b|` milliseconds, where `a` and `b` are the indices of consecutive digits in `digits`.

### Steps to Solve:
1. Map each digit in `digits` to its position (index).
2. Initialize the total time as 0.
3. For each consecutive pair of digits in `num`, calculate the time as the absolute difference in positions between them.
4. Sum up these times to get the final answer.

Here’s the Python code implementing this approach:

```python
def solution(digits: str, num: str) -> int:
    # Create a mapping of each digit to its index in `digits`
    digit_position = {digit: idx for idx, digit in enumerate(digits)}
    
    # Initialize total time
    total_time = 0
    
    # Iterate over consecutive pairs of digits in `num`
    for i in range(1, len(num)):
        # Calculate the time to move between consecutive digits
        time = abs(digit_position[num[i]] - digit_position[num[i - 1]])
        # Add to the total time
        total_time += time
    
    return total_time
```

### Explanation of Code:
- **`digit_position`**: A dictionary mapping each digit in `digits` to its index, which allows O(1) lookup time.
- **Loop through `num`**: For each consecutive pair in `num`, it calculates the absolute difference between their indices in `digits`.
- **Sum up the differences**: Adds each calculated time to `total_time`.

### Example Walkthrough:
Using the provided example:

```python
# Example 1
print(solution("0123456789", "210"))  # Output: 4

# Example 2
print(solution("8459761203", "5439"))  # Output: 17
```

### Explanation for Example 1:
- Input: `digits = "0123456789"`, `num = "210"`
- Mapping: `{'0': 0, '1': 1, '2': 2, ..., '9': 9}`
- Calculate movements:
  - From `2` to `1`: `|2 - 1| = 1`
  - From `1` to `0`: `|1 - 0| = 1`
- Total time = `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`

This should solve the problem as per the description. Let me know if you'd like more help!
